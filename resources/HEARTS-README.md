# HEARTS ♥️

## Project Theme
* We focused on 4 main implementations we think would be the most beneficial to the app: Live Streaming, Currency System, Special Events/Tournaments, and a Referral System.

## Core Features:
### Live Streaming:
We integrated Amazon IVS in React to enable live streaming of gameplay directly within the app. Players can broadcast their games, host live events, and interact with their audience in real-time.

A live chat feature with built-in moderation filters inappropriate language and ensures a positive, inclusive environment.
This feature focuses on fostering community engagement, allowing players to connect on a deeper level during live events.

### Currency System:
Players can purchase in-game currencies, diamonds, hearts, spades, and clubs, which can be cashed out for real money. A small transaction fee is applied.

The system drives player engagement by allowing customization options, like badges and card skins, available in the in-game shop.

### Special Events & Tournaments:
Seasonal, holiday-based events (e.g., Christmas, Halloween) offer exclusive in-game experiences, such as custom stages and limited-edition skins.

We plan to host annual or biannual tournaments, where players compete for rewards, such as in-game currency and exclusive profile customizations. These events create excitement and boost user retention.

### Referral System:
Users are rewarded with Diamonds, Hearts, Spades, and Clubs, for every new user who joins the platform via their referral code.

This system promotes viral growth and keeps the in-game economy active.

## Solution
* We focused on integrating live streaming, alongside other features, to give users a fully immersive experience. Live streaming is key for building community interaction and engagement. Using Amazon IVS, players can broadcast their gameplay and create live, interactive events that strengthen the community around the game.

#### Motivation
* We were motivated to include live streaming because it's a growing trend in the gaming world. By adding live chat and moderation, we are not just enabling streams but also fostering safe and positive community engagement.

#### Social Impact
* The live streaming feature enhances the social dynamics of the game, allowing players to share their experiences, host events, and engage with a broader audience, creating a more connected community.

#### Economic Impact
* The in-game currency system encourages player investment, both in time and money, as they can cash out their winnings. The small transaction fee ensures a sustainable model for developers while offering real monetary rewards for players.

### Other Solutions Considered
* We considered using alternative streaming platforms but settled on Amazon IVS due to its low latency and ease of integration. Other solutions lacked real-time engagement or were too complex to deploy within the timeframe of the hackathon.

## Obstacles

### Technical
* Integrating Amazon IVS into a React-based frontend was challenging at first but proved essential for enabling smooth live-streaming functionality.


### Non-technical
* Balancing the currency system to ensure profitability for players without compromising the game's economy required a thoughtful design and testing process.
